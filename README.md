# xaringan_rhul

This project contains a [Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) template for Royal Holloway, University of London.

The template is based on Royal Holloway's [brand guidelines](https://intranet.royalholloway.ac.uk/staff/tools-and-links/brand-toolkit/home.aspx).

I've ignored, however, the Powerpoint template, because I think it has a lot more visual cruft than the branding guidelines themselves.
